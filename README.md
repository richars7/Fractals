# Fractals
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over.

Mandlebrot Set: 
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers {\displaystyle c} c for which the function {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c} {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c} does not diverge when iterated from {\displaystyle z=0} z=0, i.e., for which the sequence {\displaystyle f_{c}(0)} {\displaystyle f_{c}(0)}, {\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))} {\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}, etc., remains bounded in absolute value.
