# Fractals
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over.

The basic formula for the Mandelbrot set is:

Z = Z^2 + C

The Mandelbrot set is determined by iterating with this equation.  By iterating, I mean that we start with a value for Z and C. We plug these into the equation to get a new value for Z.  We then plug that value for Z in and get a new Z, and so on.
